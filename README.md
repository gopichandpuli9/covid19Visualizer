# covid19Visualizer
The world is grappling with an invisible, deadly enemy, trying to understand how to live with the threat posed by the coronavirus.

“A picture is worth a thousand words“ 
As the quote speaks, Data visualization helps to derive information insights from data sources in a better way. so through this article, I want to showcase how one can visualize a map of their own country and how various boroughs and neighborhoods are affected by this dreadful virus.

Data Description:
For developing this application we need some data that need to be scrapped from websites
We need latitude and longitude coordinates of all the Indian states, we can scrap this data from quicksgs.com using python.
We need the current status of coronavirus in the various states of the country, we can scrap this dynamic data from Wikipedia using python.
